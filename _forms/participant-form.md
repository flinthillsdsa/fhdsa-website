Help us build a stronger, more connected Flint Hills DSA community! We're asking all current participants - whether you're a DSA member, mailing list subscriber, event attendee, or community supporter - to fill out this form so we can better coordinate our organizing efforts and ensure everyone gets the information and opportunities most relevant to them.

This form will help us understand your:

- Current contact information and communication preferences
- Organizing and volunteer interests
- Policy and issue priorities
- Accessibility needs and dietary accommodations
- Preferred ways to get involved with chapter activities

**Important Note About Email Changes:** If you need to update your email address, please email **membership@fhdsa.org** directly to request this change. Entering a new email on this form will create a duplicate entry in our database rather than updating your existing information.

Your responses help us organize more effectively, plan inclusive events, and connect you with the working groups and activities that match your interests. All information is kept confidential and used only for chapter organizing and communication purposes.

Thank you for being part of building working-class power in the Flint Hills region!
