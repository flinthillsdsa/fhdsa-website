      <p>The Flint Hills Chapter of DSA is based in Manhattan, Kansas and incorporates surrounding rural areas. You can use <a href="https://chapters.dsausa.org/" target="_blank">this tool</a> to check to see if your zipcode falls within our DSA Chapter.</p>
      
      <p>As a member run organization, all of our major decisions are decided democratically. We rely on our members to organize and run meetings, events, fundraisers, campaigns, etc. Without an active membership base, we wouldn't be able to function. We are socialists in your community, dedicating what little free time capitalism affords us to building a better future.</p>
      
      <p>The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest Socialist organization in the United States, and here in the Flint Hills, we have a unique opportunity to build working class power in an area often overlooked by the rest of the country. We know that a better world is possible, and if you're ready to fight for that world, join us.</p>
